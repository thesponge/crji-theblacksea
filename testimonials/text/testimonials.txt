CRJI and its director Stefan Candea are a vital ray of light in Eastern Europe. In a region mired in corruption and media manipulation, they work to keep alive a genuinely professional standard of investigative journalism.

The Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism does, what needs to be done: its journalists investigate thoroughly, they are courageous, they are committed, they know their journalistic methods apply them skillfully. They manage to unveil corruption as well as trafficking, they analyse businesses as sharply as they produce moving social reportage.

We need to work with organizations like the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism more than ever, to ensure that deep-dig journalism survives. The mainstream media is undergoing dramatic change and it is up to us all to help preserve the best parts.

There is no more important role for journalism today than investigative reporting and the duty of investigative journalists to dig out information the powerful want kept secret and enlightening citizens around the world so that they may act in the interest of freedom. The Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism demonstrates research and investigative skills that merit your support in carrying forth its essential investigative mission.

As investigative reporters covering issues like international financial crime and corruption myself and my colleagues in our team at Swedish Television constantly rely on international colleagues for help and interpretation of foreign matters. Our friends at CRJI are some of the most trusted colleagues we have worked with, the investigation into “Offshore‑leaks” possibly being the most prominent. CRJI have an extreme journalistic access and knowledge about some of the most troubled parts of Europe and provide vital help for us and other reporters. I can only congratulate any colleagues who manages to set up a cooperation with CRJI.

I was working with the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism over the “Offshore leaks” that was initiated by Washington based ICIJ. I was impressed by professionalism and competence of Romanian Center and especially by the ability to work operative with massive information databases keeping the sources of that information under protection with the help of the most modern techniques. The Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism is connected to news makers and sources all over the world, and even if they miss some countries – they compensate by cooperation with the best local investigative reporters.

I worked with Stefan and the CRJI on topics as difficult and complex as cigarettes smuggling, black sites for torture and detention, the offshoring of organized crime operations. During all those years, breaking the news in Brussels in partnership with our Romanian colleagues, I’ve been astonished by the quality and legal reliability of the evidence collected: covert video footage, classified docs, financial docs, you name it. On more than a decade of cooperation and hard hitting revelations, we never lost any legal action.

Stefan Candea is one of the preeminent investigative journalists in the world and one of the earliest pioneers in the nonprofit journalism ecosystem. And the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism is one of the most intrepid, fearless news organizations anywhere. Bravo and thank you for your astonishing courage and steadfast pursuit of the truth!
